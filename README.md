# Transmission_of_Temp_using_DS18B20
Using the DS18B20 temperature sensor and the ATMEGA328P microcontroller to transmit data with LiFi.  
I am only going to be developing the code that would allow me to use 1 module on the bus.  
  
As of right now, initDS18B20(), reading of information and writing of information is working properly.
